# IDT_UNEXCOM_War_on_Mars
 UNEXCOM: War on Mars, is a standalone sequel for the OpenXcom mod UNEXCOM, made by the IDT. This mod is located after the defeat of the aliens of the main mod, on the United Nations campaign to explore, colonize and conquest the Red Planet in the name of Mankind. The side purpose of the Expansion Pack is to use the same assets from UNEXCOM and a smaller tech.

This project is meant as an expansion pack for UNEXCOM, located on the United Nation campaign on Mars after the end of the main game.

Using as basis the great work made by liberation on his awesome mod "Battle for Mars", but updated to the newest OXCE standards, this is meant to be rather quick game. It doesn't have a large tech tree and most (if not all) weapons and equipment are the late game stuff from the main campaign. Actually, is like a resource dump for those sprites. It does include a small story.
