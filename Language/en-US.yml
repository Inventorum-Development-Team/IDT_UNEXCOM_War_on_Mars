  STR_FIGHTERS_UFOPEDIA: "Fighter craft are both fast and agile, suitable for hunting smaller UFOs. Usually only equipped with short-range weaponry, they rely on agility to dodge enemy attacks to survive. Fighters are most effective when used in groups, since it is integral to shoot down the target UFO as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of fire the fighter takes."
  STR_BOMBERS: "Bombers"
  STR_BOMBERS_UFOPEDIA: "Bomber craft are capable of carrying large amounts of heavy munitions. Equipped with long-range weaponry, they are usually capable to engage UFOs without entering their weapon-range. This makes bombers suitable to engage larger UFOs equipped with lethal weaponry without risk. However bombers struggle to catch smaller UFOs and can easily get caught by hunter-killer UFOs."
  STR_RECONS: "Reconnaissance Craft"
  STR_RECONS_UFOPEDIA: "Reconnaissance craft have the sole purpose of spotting UFOs, they are also the only type of craft capable of finding alien bases. {NEWLINE} {NEWLINE}Spy planes are fast moving craft undetectable by hunter-killers, suitable for chasing and identifying UFOs. They are also exceptional at finding bases, since they do not get targeted by the base's interceptors. {NEWLINE} {NEWLINE}Satellites are slow-moving, however they excel at detecting UFOs compared to ground based installations. Early satellites are vulnerable to hunter-killer UFOs, while upgraded designs get access to ways in which to defend themselves."

  STR_UNEXCOM_FIGHTERS_UFOPEDIA: "Our fighters and bombers are the first line of defense we have, we have them to defend the skies of our planet. Powers such as the US, NATO and USSR allow us to have access to the quantities we need from their aircraft, as well as support personnel and pilots, as well as the best in aeronautics and weapons technology. All of our fighters, bombers and transports has been upgraded with fuel tanks to increase combat range. Also, we can use prototype recon satellites to help us in our mission to guard the skies."

  STR_LIGHT_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Infrared homing is a passive weapon guidance system which uses the infrared (IR) light emission from a target to track and follow it. Missiles which use infrared seeking are often referred to as 'heat-seekers', since infrared is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Aircraft generate and emit heat, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background. Analysis conducted in the air combat of Massachusetts led to that, apparently, the UFOs reflect certain type of heat. Probably from their engines. It's not some kind of radiation known to us, but it can get some lock using the IR missiles."

  STR_HEAVY_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Semi-active radar homing (SARH) is a common type of missile guidance system, perhaps the most common type for longer-range air-to-air. The name refers to the fact that the missile itself is only a passive detector of a radar signal – provided by an external source, (mostly craft-mounted radar) as it reflects off the target. Semi-active missile systems use bistatic continuous-wave radar. Our collected information reports that the material with which they appear to be constructed reflects the radar waves, making it more difficult to lock an enemy with this kind of missiles. "

  STR_SUPER_HEAVY_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Missiles armed with nuclear warheads, modified for use by UNEXCOM. Slow, but more accurate than conventional missiles, having more time to compute the path and distance of the target, employ a combination of IR and active radar guidance. Their weight and characteristics prevent them from having a long reach. It is highly recommended to use them only in cases of emergency."

  STR_GATLING_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: " {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Gatling-type cannon is a rapid-firing weapon that utilizes multiple barrels in a rotating cluster to provide a sustained rate of fire greater than single-barreled machine guns or automatic cannon of equivalent caliber. The loading, firing, and unloading functions are performed simultaneously in different barrels as they rotate, and the rotation also permits the barrels some time to cool. However, they tend to be somewhat inaccurate because of the enormous power generated by the weapon's mechanism."

  STR_REVOLVER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: " {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This type of autocannon uses the revolver principle to accelerate the cycle of loading, firing and ejecting multiple rounds of ammunition, achieving a very high rate of fire compared to conventional cannon of the same calibre. Revolver cannon are generally able to be made much lighter than gatling guns, requiring less support and mounting hardware. The power and reliability of this type of guns allow to use heavier ammunition calibres without compromising the stability or accuracy of the weapon."

  STR_AUXILIARY_POD_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These auxiliary systems are mounted in hardpoints in the wings and under the fuselage, are used to increase the performance in some aspects of the aircraft that carries them, such as combat range or performance in battle. It is recommended to choose carefully, most include some drawbacks."

  STR_ROCKET_POD_UFOPEDIA: "Rocket Pods are short range weapons, high speed and fast fire rate. They are not guided, so they are quite imprecise. Trying to use them against small, agile targets is useless. It is basically a shotgun for airplanes. They have the ability to project a large amount of explosives over a large area. Its primary design was to saturate the sky in front of enemy bombers to bring them down."

  STR_TUNNAN_UFOPEDIA: "J29 Tunnan - Old model of airplane of Swedish origin, despite its age is very maneuverable, tough and very appreciated by its pilots. Famous for its actions in the congo and the swedish UFO incident. Tunnan means 'barrel'."

  STR_HERCULES_UFOPEDIA: "C-130 Hercules - Military transport aircraft, extendedly employed by numerous armies. Used to transport unexcom personnel, troops and supplies, modified to include enhanced fuel tanks. Troopers jump on parachute from the plane directly into battle, allowing a quick and stealth insertion."

  STR_HUEY_UFOPEDIA: "UH-1 Huey - Light transport helicopter, employed to insert and evacuate troops quickly in the battlefield. It has a short range, our troops must be taken on c-130s to mission sites before the deployment. Armed with weapon hardpoints to provide close support and engage targets"

  STR_PHANTOM_UFOPEDIA: "F-4 Phantom II - Standard air superiority fighter plane of unexcom, it's a widely spread aircraft in the nato air forces. Modified to incorporate large internal fuel tanks to increase combat range."

  STR_THUNDERCHIEF_UFOPEDIA: "F-105 Thunderchief - Supersonic strike bomber, has more bomb load than some bombers of wwii. It's employed by unexcom to provide heavy aerial support when engaging UFOs."

The internals are housed inside a durable casing, made out of an unknown metal alloy. After losing the War of 1972 (and much of their previous equipment in Earth), the aliens were forced to adopt other designs... more similar to our weapons. We can theorize they believe our lasers are better than theirs, as we won the conflict in our planet. Some others think it's a matter of adapting what seems more useful with less resources. Their quality is lower than the weapons used since the Secret Crisis in the early 60s, but you shouldn't understimate their letality."


  STR_ALIEN_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "A small, personal defense weapon issued by the Insurgents. It features a different barrel with a series of lights indicating the amount of battery left on the weapon. The accuracy isn't any better on this gun, but seems to be easy to distribute as it's widely seen in the hands of the aliens. "


  STR_ALIEN_LASER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The new Laser Rifle field by the alien guerrillas seems to be based in our designs. The energy capacitors powering the alien crystal seem to be run along the barrel. In order to increase the handling of the weapon, the alien gunsmiths have added a small forward stock-like protude just below the barrel, perhaps mimicking how our weapons are used by the infantry."

  STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "Very different to the original Heavy Laser, this new support weapon seems to fill the role of a human automatic rifle. It overheats rather quickly, but the energy bursts emitted by this weapon turns it into a dangerous tool. It lacks accuracy, which also makes difficult to use... and easy to commit friendly fire."


  STR_ALIEN_CRYSTAL_UFOPEDIA: "This crystal is found in every alien laser weapon. While early research concluded that the crystal is the power source of the laser weaponry, this is only partially true. Funneling a weak laser trough the crystal seems to cause a nuclear reaction within it, amplifying the power of the laser. If we extract these crystals from the alien weaponry we could use them to construct powerful laser weapons of our own"
  STR_FLECHETTE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A new design made by UNEXCOM Armory features a heavier barrel with an integral suppressor to help dissipate the recoil. The standard model lacks a stock to allow easier handle inside closed environments like spaceships and pressurized habitats."

  STR_FLECHETTE_MACHINE_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "This compact machine gun is intended to be the standard secondary weapon for light and mechanized infantry troops, as well as armored vehicle and artillery crews. It is slightly heavier than our standard M1911 Colt, but its ammunition is considerably lighter. The recoil is very manageable and has a fire selector for bursts and automatic mode. It cannot fire in semi-automatic mode."

  STR_ALLOY_RIFLE_AP_UFOPEDIA: "Based on the .280 British (also known as 7mm NATO) experimental cartridge, it has proven to be reliable and can be adapted to our requirements with relative ease. This cartridge contains depleted uranium core and Alien Alloys coating, facilitating target penetration."

  STR_ALLOY_RIFLE_FL_UFOPEDIA: "This intermediate cartridge has the right size to be adapted to shoot Flechette bullets. Compared to the original .280 British cartridge (recognized for its ease of use), our 7mm FL bullets are light enough to be transported in large quantities. It is recommended to avoid their use against armored enemies, TCe to the poor penetration of AA Flechettes."

  STR_ALLOY_PISTOL_AP_UFOPEDIA: "Using a modified version of the .45 ACP bullets we have been able to obtain satisfactory results in the armor penetration tests. Having the size of a .45 ACP bullet, but with a depleted uranium core, this cartridge has the stopping power of a conventional battle rifle, but with the size of a pistol bullet. "

  STR_ALLOY_PISTOL_FL_UFOPEDIA: "Using .45 ACP bullets as a base, our gunsmith engineers have created a hollow cartridge containing Flechettes made with AA. In addition to the bullet's own stopping power, the interior of the bullet contains an unspecified amount of Alien Alloys that fragment upon impact with a soft object... this is in addition to its very light weight."

  STR_ALLOY_SHOTGUN_FL_UFOPEDIA: "Designed to provide containment fire at greater distances than those offered by other shotguns, they are the perfect complement to the XM12 shotgun. Their range is quite limited, but this (far from being a problem) is quite useful to create a very concentrated cloud of fire over medium distances. "

  STR_ALLOY_AUTO_SHOTGUN_FL_UFOPEDIA: "The pellets of this shotgun were specially optimized to cover a wide surface, saturating the area with Flechettes. Its power at short distance is unrivaled, but it is completely useless at longer distances. Each .12 gauge cartridge used by the XM120 shotgun contains 10 Alien Alloy Flechettes"

  STR_ALLOY_HEAVY_AP_UFOPEDIA: "Powerful 20mm caliber ammunition, contains a core of depleted uranium and tungsten It is optimized for tearing down heavy armor, the high firepower greatly boosts in this function. Many soldiers are surprised to see such a large yet lightweight projectile."

  STR_ALLOY_HEAVY_FL_UFOPEDIA: "A special high-capacity magazine, the Flechettes use a 20mm caliber cap just like the AP depleted uranium bullets, except that they are considerably lighter. Their ability to cause injury is important and the enormous capacity of the magazine allows for long suppression fire on the enemy."

  STR_ALLOY_SNIPER_AP_UFOPEDIA: "A highly specialized projectile is basically a javelin of depleted uranium, placed inside a bullet made of AA. Upon penetrating a target, the TC javelin is propelled by the kinetic energy of the projectile, making a clean hole in various types of armor. Designed to wreak hard targets from far away."

  STR_ALLOY_SNIPER_FL_UFOPEDIA: "This experimental projectile contains an oversized Alien Alloys Flechette, which upon impact with the skin of a soft target, breaks instantly and can cause critical injuries that are very difficult to patch up. However, it will collapse without much damage if it hits a hard enemy. It is specially modified for long distance shooting."

  STR_30MM_AAG_UFOPEDIA: "Small yet powerful 30mm explosive grenades. Originally designed for a Soviet grenade launcher, we have adopted it.  It's very versatile and light enough to carry it on large quantities."

It is basically the original model of Gyrojet gun created by the company MBA in the 60s, but adapted to use removable magazines. Soldiers call it 'the space spy gun' because of its stealthy qualities and ability to be used in the total vacuum of space."
  STR_GYROJET_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Co-designed with the original creators of the Gyrojet concept, MBA and the American company Colt, this combat rifle is similar to the Gyrojet rifle presented by MBA to the U.S. Army a few years ago, with several internal differences: the firing mechanism was adapted so that it can be fed with removable mags, instead of the internal fixed magazine of the original model, and the wood was replaced with polymers qualified for use in space."
  STR_GYROJET_AMMO_MAGAZINE_UFOPEDIA: "The rocket ammunition used by our guns is visually similar to a .45 caliber ACP bullet, but over-dimensioned. Inside carries a special propellant charge within a self-contained casing, basically making it a micro missile. It can operate in the vacuum of space. Its penetration capacity is considerable for a bullet of its size, but it suffers a small disadvantage: having little initial kinetic energy when the projectile leaves the barrel of the gun. This makes it inaccurate at short distances. However, it is compact enough to be transported in large quantities."

  STR_SMOKE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This American manufactured grenade dates from the

    end of the WW2, is used as a signaling device, a target or landing zone

  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_RESEARCH_1_UFOPEDIA: The complete analysis on this new type of alien weapons has been finished. With this data and the interrogations made to enemy engineers, we have discovered that these weapons are clearly of animal origin, of an aquatic species. Some of these are living beings, but the vast majority are shells and claws of what appear to be crustaceans.

  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_RESEARCH_2_UFOPEDIA: They are incredibly resistant to heat and high pressure, so we believe that the animals from which these artifacts come are incredibly tough. The brutal energy discharge from these weapons makes them terrifying, it's as if every alien soldier is armed with a powerful rocket launcher. The energy released seems to be controlled and focused on a certain area.

  STR_INITIAL_FUSION_CELLS_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: Bio-Fusion weapons use a very interesting source of power. We have no record of anything similar in our research, which leads us to believe that aliens are constantly improving their technology to stay one step ahead of us. The texture of these batteries (if you can call them that) is viscous and their smell is foul. It stores a lot of energy with unprecedented efficiency, which can be harvested to obtain raw Elerium. A real mystery.

  STR_ALIEN_CEPHALOPOD_TISSUE_UFOPEDIA: The partially rotten carcasses of the Fusion weapon remains are essentially alien crab and squid corpses, cobbled together around a miniature reactor. The incredible resistance of the biological structure allow the weapons to withstand the huge surges of power when used with Alien Alloys used to support and make wielding surfaces (like stocks, handguards and triggers). We can reuse them with relative ease, as they are strickling similar to Earth's biological fauna - which we have abundant theory -.

  STR_HUMAN_FUSION_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA_1: "An UNEXCOM developed bio-fusion weapon built from scavenged alien weapons. A extremely powerful weapon, capable of destroying a Sectopod with a single shot while still being light enough to be carried by a single man. Operated solely by UNEXCOM forces, only a handful of the weapon have been made."
  STR_HUMAN_FUSION_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA_2: "The rifle was initially held in high regard by UNEXCOM troops and envied by allied forces, though its popularity waned after a catastrophic malfunction killed one of the weapons operators alongside one of their squadmates. The lack of abundant ammo reduces its tactical use, as there are limited reserves of Bio-Fusion cells"

  STR_FUSION_HANDGUN_UFOPEDIA: The Fusion Handgun is a lightweight, compact weapon made of a material equally resistant to Alien Alloys, but of unknown origin. It can fire energy projectiles at high speed and appears to be our enemy's new secondary weapon. Its devastating effect is surprising for its size.

  STR_FUSION_SMG_UFOPEDIA: Powerful assault weapon, in concept it is similar to our sub-machine guns. It's quite bulky, but surprisingly light when carried, suggesting that it's used for quick and sneak attacks. Its lethality lies in its ability to saturate an area with small fusion explosions, obliterating any unprotected living creature in its range.

  STR_FUSION_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: This is a new, robust and powerful battle rifle. For some strange reason, its firing mechanism limits it to semi-automatic fire, which is a relief for our troops. It's not very accurate, perhaps because of the material it's made of. But it is precisely this material that allows it to be used in close combat, like a mallet or a club.

  STR_FUSION_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: Fearsome long-range weapon. Judging by our analysis in combat, it is difficult to use (it is rarely fired in the course of battle) because of its considerable weight, but it is compensated for by its terrifying accuracy. The design and functionality is very reminiscent of an anti-tank rifle, similar to those used in WW2. Perhaps the designers' intention was to use it to disable our vehicles.

  STR_FUSION_SPLITTER_UFOPEDIA: A large yet light alien close combat weapon, its used as a shotgun to clear human fortified positions and urban zones. The most fearsome characteristic of this weapon, its the claw-like protrude on the front of the weapon. Similar to crab or ant claws, it closes quickly and is able to amputate limbs of humans with ease.

  STR_FUSION_LANCE_UFOPEDIA: It seems a squid-like creature was surgically attached to a large structure made of Alien Alloys. While this may be an unusual configuration, even unwieldy, this weapon projects a large and wide Fusion energy beam able to penetrate thick layers of titanium in a matter of seconds. The large stress on the alien squid-like creature kills it after approximately 10 uses.

  STR_ETHEREAL_NOBLE_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: An ancient relic from a distant past, used by the Ethereal equivalent of our knights and lords. It's an extremely rare item used just by the very best soldiers in the enemy's army. It's use is not longer restricted to Ethereals only, but they are the only ones able to make them and bestow them on their new users. It channels the psi-force of the wielder to bolster the damage of the attack.

  STR_THERMONUCLEAR_PROJECTILE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: Perhaps one of the most destructive weapons on the alien arsenal, this siege weapon is designed to obliterate fortifications with pinpoint accuracy. It's roughly the equivalent of our tactical nuclear launchers (like the M29 Davy Crockett), but with the unique ability of focusing all the Elerium Fusion energy blast into a very small area.

  STR_TEXAN_UFO_UFOPEDIA: Old turboprop aircraft created in 1935, recognized worldwide as a stable and reliable aircraft. Often used as a training and light attack aircraft, it is incredibly popular. Terrorists often steal them from civilian airfields and equip them with black market weapons for use in their missions.

  STR_MAGISTER_UFO_UFOPEDIA: Advanced training plane, built in France. It is often used as a ground attack plane and has seen action in various conflicts, both on the government force and on the rebel side. Terrorists have purchased Sidewinder missiles on the black market and are equipping them at Magister on intercept missions.

  STR_MI8_TERRORIST_UFO_UFOPEDIA: One of the most widely used helicopters in the world, the Mi-8s we face were supplied to our enemies by Superpowers, secret agencies, rebel countries or simply stolen from government hangars. It has short-range defensive weapons and can transport large numbers of troops.

  STR_MI8_UFO_UFOPEDIA: One of the most widely used helicopters in the world, the Mi-8s we face were supplied to our enemies by Superpowers, secret agencies, rebel countries or simply stolen from government hangars. It has short-range defensive weapons and can transport large numbers of troops.

#  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Applying the nano-scale alloy manufacturing process towards power cell technology has placed the research team on the cusp of producing viable directed-energy weapons. With energy constraints removed, the research team expanded on a novel laser weapon technology previously in development in multiple countries during the early 1960s. Initial application will be in interceptor weaponry, with miniaturization of the technology for use in small arms possible later with refinement of the design and construction process

  STR_PEACEMAKER_UFOPEDIA: "The Peacemaker is the standard energy weapon used by UNEXCOM since the '73. Hard-hitting, with decent accuracy and rate of fire. Substantially better than the alien laser rifles it was based on. The major downside is the manufacturing costs, making it unviable for mass production. Each rifle is handcrafted by UNEXCOM gunsmiths."

  STR_M1972_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "After acquiring of license for laser technology, Savage Arms developed a new handgun, which was adopted by US Army and even some security companies. Savage Arms managed to create miniature charging system, which perfomance was similar to perfomance of M1972 handgun, while being smaller and lighter, thanks to the use of new alloy. M77 Rasputin use design of Savage Model 1907, well-known handgun from the beginning of 20th Century."

  STR_38_LASER_MAGNUM_UFOPEDIA: "Magnum Research acquired license for laser technology in 1976 and started development of a new powerful handgun. Constructors managed to create strong-looking handgun with powerful charging system and accurate lenses. New alloys, used in this weapon, allows to make it relatively light. This new Daring Eagle handgun was accepted by USSF (United States Space Forces) as self-defense gun for pilots, and optional sidearm for soldiers, looking for handgun, capable of killing strong aliens. Daring Eagle also became popular in Hollywood, being featured in recent action movies, thanks to it's brutal design."

  STR_CALBR_UFOPEDIA: "After first stage of war with Ethereals, United States Army ordered a new main battle rifle for USSF from an ArmaLite. Eugene Stoner, although being new to the laser technologies, still managed to create a powerful, accurate and reliable gun. Based upon design of a M63 Stoner, new CALBR-76 also features it's modularity, giving ability to easily change stock, grip, scope, fire mods and etc."
  
  STR_CALBR_DMR_UFOPEDIA: "Modified version of CALBR-76. This one features a new 8x scope, with several different zoom modes, bipod, and differently focused charging system, making this rifle more powerful, but removing automatic fire."

  STR_M20_M203_LASER_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "In 1978, the US Army started competition among armament companies for a new laser carbine for the Army Rangers and Airborne paratroopers. This competition was won by Knight's Armament Company, with their M54C. Being light and compact, this carbine also managed to be almost as powerful as a CALBR-76. This weapon also features cutting-edge scope with several modes, including heat vision, infravision and targets tracking."

  STR_M5_LASER_SMG_UFOPEDIA: "In 1979, for the the request of the US Navy SEALs, KRISS USA have created a new laser submachine gun, known as KRISS Radiant. With if unusual design, KRISS USA managed to create both light and powerful SMG, suitable for special operations in various conditions. KRISS Radiant was accepted by the SEALs in 1980, and by USSF in 1981 as an optional self-defence weapon for pilots."

  STR_ULYSSES_LASER_SNIPER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Recently founded in 1980 by Ronnie Barrett, Barrett Firearms has started a development of their own laser sniper rifle, aiming to get contract with the US Army. In the next year, Ronnie Barrett and his team created the new M49 Mountaineer sniper rifle. Accurate and powerful, this rifle also received new revolutionary scope with digital touchscreen, allowing the user switch between several different modes, be it heatvision, infravision, target tracking or sun protection. This sniper rifle was accepted by the Army at the end of 1981, by the name of M49 Mountaineer, and currently it's replacing an Ulysses Sniper Rifle."

  STR_X4_LASER_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Designed for USSF in 1981 by Remington Arms, Remington 700L features a new charging system and lenses, making it possible to shoot 9 rays at once. It's also have a small weight and compact size, making Remington 700L perfect for close-quarters combat."

  STR_M4_LASER_LMG_UFOPEDIA: "In 1979, the United States Army started competition among armament companies to create a new laser light machine gun. This competition was won by General Electrics, with their M565 Microlaser. Design for this machine laser based on a famous M134 Minigun, featuring electronic rotating system for 6 barrels. With new and improved cooling system, M565 Microlaser managed to get really high firerate, although it's heavier and less accurate, in comparison with M4 Laser LMG."

  STR_ELERIUM_FLAMETHROWER_UFOPEDIA: "One of the most terrifying weapons fielded by the US and UNEXCOM forces since the '73, there were reports of aliens surrendering upon sight of this weapon. The ultrahot stream of Elerium-infused napalm keeps burning even after the unfortunate target dies. The M55A2 operators were often attacked by the enemy, most likely motivated by a combination of fear and hatred."
  
  STR_P71_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA_1: "When NATO started a competition for new laser handgun in 1977, among well-known armament companies, such as 'Heckler und Koch' and 'Beretta', was an unknown Austrian engineer, known as Gaston Glock. And yet his design of a pistol, using not only new alloys, but also polymers, made Glock's handgun lighter and cheaper than the competitors designs."
  
  STR_P71_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA_2: "And so, in 1978, a newly formed Glock armament company received a huge contract for producing it's handgun, which was oficially named Glock 17LP (Laser Pistole), for the use in UASCNAT forces (United Aerospace Command of North Atlantic Treaty). Thanks to it's relatively cheap production and reliability Glock 17LP also became first laser handgun from European armament company, that made it's way into civilian gun market."

  STR_FN_FLA_LASER_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Designed by 'Steyr-Daimler-Puch', ArmeeLaserGewehr (or ALG-77), is a rifle from a new generation. Build out of new alloys and using innovative ideas in weapon-making sphere, this rifle managed to achieve high level of modularity, being able to use any additional sidegrades, ever produced by western armament companies. This rifle was quickly accepted by NATO in 1978 and soon became new main battle rifle in it's forces."

  STR_FN_FLA_LASER_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "Laser carbine, developed by Royal Small Arms Factory. This light and accurate weapon is suitable for close-quarters combat, but it's lacking a power. Yet it's a good weapon for carbine niche, so RSAF LC-80 was accepted in 1980 by UASCNAT, as a weapon for assault groups."

  STR_L4_ASSAULT_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "The LG3-ZF ('LazerGewehr Zielfernrohr' , or 'Laser Rifle Scoped' in German) is a designated marksman rifle, built by Heckler und Koch armament company in 1979. It's uses design of G3 rifles and also features new and improved cooling system, making this rifle highly reliable. It's powerful and accurate DMR, good for supporting troops in a battle."

  STR_MAT72_SUBMACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA_1: "Despite high reviews of L4 by various ranks of NATO forces during War of 1972, Heckler und Koch armament company wasn't quite pleased with the revenue they made from it's production, so in 1976 they created a new laser SMG." 
  STR_MAT72_SUBMACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA_2: "Being modeled after iconic MP5, LMP6K light, compact and really powerful for it's size, suitable for use in spec ops operations and as self-defence weapon for pilots of UASCNAT. It was accepted by NATO in 1978, and many different nations in Organisation purchased them in large numbers."

  STR_CHURCHILL_MARKSMAN_LASER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The Mauser LSSG-80 (Laserscharfschützengewehr, or Laser Sniper Rifle in German) is a sniper rifle, developed by Mauser company for the use in UASCNAT forces. This weapon features improved charging system, which makes shots more powerful and accurate. Also, this rifle received a new scope with several vision modes available for user."

  STR_ML73_LASER_MACHINE_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "The FN Minimi Machine Laser was developed by FN Herstal in 1977. This weapon, in comparison with ML-73, have better and more powerful cooling system, and more toned lenses, with higher firerate and accuracy as a result. This machine laser has already received high reviews by soldiers and officers from various countries of NATO."

  STR_M72_AUTOMATIC_RECOILLESS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "An American 40mm recoilless rifle that combines old and new technology, used both by the US and NATO. The 'Teddy' is capable of firing 6 rounds without reloading and fires both anti infantry and anti tank munitions. Named after US president Theodore Roosevelt."
  STR_M72_AUTOMATIC_RECOILLESS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Originally developed during the first stage of war with Ethereals, M72 was modified in a preparation for martian campaign. M72A1 Teddy received a reinforced firing system to reduce chance of jamming in case of being soiled by martian dust."

  STR_P72_COMPACT_LASER_UFOPEDIA_1: During the first stage of war with Ethereals, General Mirinov and his bureau received a quite amount of complaint about P-72, generally users were complaining about its low realibility and accuracy. In a responce they constructed a new model of laser handgun. 

  STR_P72_COMPACT_LASER_UFOPEDIA_2: Built completely out of new alloys and packed with a reworked cooling system, as well as improved lenses, new Tulskiy-Mirinov-78 (or TM-78) also have a pleasant resemblance of TT handgun, primary handgun of Red Army in Great Patriotic War. This pistol is commonly issued with thin belts, to ensure that soldier will never lose his handgun.

  STR_ALK72_LASER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: ALKh-79 (Avtomat Laserniy Kharitonova), 2nd in the line of soviet laser rifles, was designed by Mikayel Kharitonov in 1979, by request of newly formed Space Forces of Soviet Army to make a new rifle, more comfortable for cosmonauts. This rifle came up with new ergonomic stock and handheld, and also with optimized charging system, which made ALKh-79 lighter than '72 model.

  STR_KHARITONOV_LASER_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA_1: Originally developed by request of UNEXCOM, KhLBR-72 (Kharitonov Laser Battle Rifle) also found it's way into Spetznaz forces, such as Alpha or Vympel squads. War of 1972 shown for the Soviet Army value of marksman support on a battlefield, so Mikayel Kharitonov received in 1978 a new request by SA to create a DMR, both suitable for army marksman soldiers and Spetznaz operatives. 
  STR_KHARITONOV_LASER_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA_2: With new stock and optimized charging and cooling systems, SVPKh-80 (Snaiperskaya Vintovka Podderzhki Kharitonova, or Kharitonov Support Sniper Rifle in English) became significantly shorter and lighter, without loss in accuracy or power

  STR_ALP_SUBMACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA_1: KLUAO-79 (Kompaktnaya Lazernaya Ustanovka Avtomaticheskogo Ognya, Compact Laser Device of Automatic Fire) was designed by request of KGB for their Spetznaz forces, such as Alpha and Vympel squads. In order to create a laser SMG both light and comfortable for use, KBLV came up with a new stock, merged with a grip. 
  STR_ALP_SUBMACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA_2: This combined grip, as it was oficially named, together with improved charging system, helped bureau to create a weapon, not only equal to ALP Submachine, but also achieve a small increase on damage output. This weapon used only by Spetznaz, but soviet suppliers on Mars have a small shipment of them to quickly transfer it to UNEXCOM, if requested

  STR_MIRINOV_LASER_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: SVM-79 (Snaiperskaya Vintovka Mirinova) is a new laser sniper rifle, created by General Pyotr Mirinov and his bureau for Space Forces of Soviet Army specifically for martian conditions. Not only this rifle received a new cooling system and better lenses for greater accuracy, bureau also managed to add some modularity with customized grip and sights, thanks to added 'dovetail rail' mounting

  STR_AN_MACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA_1: Developed during the War of 1972, AN Machine Laser served as a fire support weapon in Soviet Army. Despite it's great damage and respectable accuracy, this weapon suffered from overheat, and in responce Constructor Bureau of Laser Weaponry (KBLO, Konstruktorskoye Byuro Lazernogo Vooruzhenia), with General Pyotr Mirinov as it's head, designed LUAO-81.

  STR_AN_MACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA_2: (Lazernaya Ustanovka Avtomaticheskogo Ognya, Laser Device of Automatic Fire). This new LMG gained new cooling system, as well as option to easily change barrel even at the battlefield, which qreatly reduced problems with overheat. This LMG was adopted by Soviet Army in 1979 and quickly replaced AN ML

  STR_AFINA_ANTITANK_LASER_UFOPEDIA_1: AFINA PTLU-M (Protivotankovaya Lazernaya Ustanovka Modificirovannaya, or Anti-Tank Laser Device Modified). Developed in a responce of a threat of alien mechanised units, such as Cyberdisks or Mechtoids, AFINA received positive reviews by various ranks of Soviet Army. Yet, there was quite amount of complaint about low rate of fire, which is deemed crucial by many, so in 1976 KBLV modernised AFINA.
  STR_AFINA_ANTITANK_LASER_UFOPEDIA_2: They improved both charging and cooling systems, which led to rate of fire being increased by 20%. In 1977 new standard for AFINA PTLU, now PTLU-M, was adopted by Soviet Army, which quickly modernised all its AFINAs

  STR_POWER_RESERVES_UFOPEDIA: "Each UNEXCOM soldier carries a small powercell as a part of their equipment, which is used to power electronic equipment, such as laser weaponry, in the field. These powercells are recharged once a soldier returns from a mission, though they can be recharged during a operation by using a battery if it proves necessary."

  STR_BATTERY_UFOPAEDIA: "This battery holds enough power to recharge the powercell of our soldiers attires fully. It is heavy, but might prove necessary on longer missions. The battery is automatically recharged when returned to the base"

  STR_ELERIUM_BATTERY_UFOPAEDIA: "This battery is extremely similar to the power cells of Alien Fusion weaponry, granting it twice the capacity of our regular batteries while being the same weight"

   STR_ELECTRIC_RIFLE: "Taifun Egewehr Electric Rifle"
   STR_ELECTRIC_RIFLE_MAG: "Electric Standard Cell (x10)"
   STR_ELECTRIC_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Based on the success of the Hurrikan Electric Rifle ten years ago, the 'Typhoon' has a double energy generator and larger batteries to increase the potency of the electrical discharge. A sturdier frame and better conductors allow a marginal increase in range. Even when its best used to disable mechanical enemies, organic threats are no match neither. The amount of discharges remains limited, though."
   STR_ELECTRIC_PISTOL: "Zyklon Epistole Electric Handgun"
   STR_ELECTRIC_PISTOL_MAG: "Electric Compact Cell (x20)"
   STR_ELECTRIC_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Cyclone' is a compact weapon meant to supplement the larger Electric Rifles, often too bulky to be carried and aimed quickly. The short size restricts the range and focusing of the discharge and the power, dispersing the lighting over a wide area. On the other hand, the battery supply lasts a bit longer due the lower energy required to operate the pistol."
   STR_GAUSS_RIFLE: "Groza EMR"
   STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_MAG: "Ferromagnetic 8mm Mag (x15)"
   STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Improved version of the Burya EMR firing the same 8mm high-armor-piercing rounds, the 'Thunderstorm' includes a tactical enhanced modification system, adding a digital scope and laser targeting sight, to greatly increase the accuracy of the marksman using the rifle. The scope automatically calculates the most optimal trajectory, helping the user to shot over longer distances. The additions put more weight into an already heavy weapon, but iincrements the effectiveness."
   STR_GAUSS_CARBINE: "Grad EMC"
   STR_GAUSS_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "A shortened Carbine version of the EMR family, the 'Hailstorm' was meant to be used by airborne assault units like the VDV. It lacks a stock and has a short barrel with fewer coils. The effective range is reduced and the weapon becomes a little unwieldy, but the weight reduction greatly helps to avoid the fatigue on the user. It uses the same 8mm rounds as the other Electromagnetic weapons."

  STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: The capture and interrogation of the alien engineer allowed researchers to finally break the lock-out technology on their weapons and fully explore the design of the alien plasma weapons. Each weapon ionizes a small pellet of Alien Alloys and uses a linear accelerator to fire the superheated metal at a target. Cultured living cells from the captured alien will have to be built into re-purposed/captured weapons in order to use the weapons, while newly constructed plasma weapons will not require this bypass.

  STR_ALIEN_COMMUNICATION_UFOPEDIA: The method of communication between alien ships seems to be a simple star style network, with each UFO communicating back with some sort of central base along a dual band microwave channel.  While the captured alien navigator provided researchers with information on the digital communication schema, decrypting the messages seems nearly impossible due to an encryption system similar to a 'one-time-pad'. Artifacts gained from a raid on an alien base may provide the UNEXCOM team with the knowledge needed to fully decrypt this communications.

  STR_HYPER_WAVE_ENCODER_UFOPEDIA: With the encryption device captured from the alien base, researchers have broken the encryption used by enemy forces.  With additional research, a new facility for intercepting alien transmissions can be constructed.

  STR_HYPER_WAVE_DECODER_UFOPEDIA: With all the details now known of the alien microwave communication protocol, researchers have produced plans for a facility that can intercept all alien communications from alien crafts within nearly a 2500 mile radius. Translators should be able to provide information on the type of UFO, the alien race and specific activity.

  STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: This lightweight plasma PDW is the sidearm fielded by the alien forces. The weapons retrieved from the battlefield have a tamper-proof friend-or-foe lock on it that we cannot seem to circumvent, and disassembly activates a process that renders the internals of the weapon to slag. Capture of an alien engineer may allow the research team to discover methods to bypass this lock.

  STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The alien plasma rifle is the main weapon platform for the aliens and can be found on a majority of their armed forces.  Like the other alien weapons, it seems to have a lock-out of some sort that prevents soldiers from simply picking up and using it and disassembly activates a self-destruct module in it.  Interrogation of a living alien engineer may provide the information needed to bypass this lock-out technology.

  STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: While alien heavy plasma weapon is the most powerful of the alien plasma weaponry, the weapon's relative inaccuracy and slow rate of fire limits its usefulness. As with the other alien plasma weapons, it is protected with a lock-out feature, capture of an alien engineer may allow the research team to discover methods to bypass this lock.

  STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: Due to the complexities of adding auto-fire to such a small weapon, the technique and methodology for producing a plasma pistol with the capabilities of the alien's weapon is beyond our reach. However, the research conducted on the weapon now allows engineers to modify and add interfaces familiar to our soldiers to any captured alien plasma pistols.

  STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: Using the information and cells gleaned from the captured engineer, researchers provided the manufacturing teams plans on how to modify captured plasma rifles to work for X-com forces, with a configuration familiar to the soldiers. Additionally, not bound by the size constraints of the plasma pistol, research can be expanded to discover how to manufacture new plasma rifles.

  STR_HUMAN_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: As the heaviest of the alien plasma weapons, this weapon proved to have it's own difficulties for the design and research team.  Despite a number of promising prototypes, producing a human-built heavy plasma weapon with the same capabilities as the alien version is impossible. Despite this, conversion of captured weapons for use by the X-com team is now possible.

  STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_MAGNUM_UFOPEDIA: Re-examining abandoned prototypes used in the failed attempts at creating new plasma pistols, the research team abandoned attempts at including auto-fire for pistol and instead concentrated on power output.  The new pistol design is analogous to the gunpowder magnum, providing more wounding energy than the .50 BMG in a one-handed weapon.

  STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_SMG_UFOPEDIA: Combining aspects of the autofire plasma rifle and previous research done on the plasma pistol, the research team created plans for a plasma submachine gun.  While not as powerful per-shot as the plasma pistol, the flash and recoil is much more manageable and the plasma bolt retains coherency at longer ranges.

  STR_NEW_HUMAN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: Constructed completely by human hands, the manufacturing team now has plans for an exact replica of the alien plasma rifle, redesigned to meet the needs of the X-com soldiers.  Other than the missing lock-out technology, this weapon is exactly the same in capabilities as the converted alien rifles. More importantly, construction of this weapon allows for further research into human designed plasma weaponry adapted for X-com fire teams, instead of just mimicking or converting existing alien weaponry.

  STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_DMR_UFOPEDIA: Replacing the auto-fire capability of the plasma rifle with the capability of creating heavier plasma shots and a more powerful linear accelerator, a plasma version of the designated marksman's rifle is now ready for construction.

  STR_HUMAN_SNIPER_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: Combining knowledge gained through the failed replication of the alien heavy plasma weapon and the successful duplication of the alien plasma rifle, scientists and engineers scaled up the plasma generator and concentrated on providing a more powerful linear accelerator, providing the weapon with high accuracy and massive damage potential.

  STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_LMG_UFOPEDIA: Expanding techniques learned with the plasma submachine gun, the research team devised squad support weapon using the plasma weapon technology by scaling up the design.  Compromising on the plasma generator, it instead boasts a staggering rate of fire while mitigating flash and recoil.

  STR_HUMAN_SMALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: This adapted launcher features the same superb handling of the alien Small Launcher and the ability to use the same ammo. We can use it against its masters to stun, capture and if needed, kill any enemy on the sight of this weapon.

  STR_CEREBREAL_UFOPAEDIA: "Cerebreals are a race that is not fully integrated into the alien hive-like society; they are more like allies, who agreed to serve the invaders for some unfathomable reasons.  They bear incredibly strong psionic powers, which can be focused as a weapon:  a violent discharge of plasma, fuelled by will alone.  Their independent and completely alien pattern of thinking make them unpredictable, but also more prone to panic than other alien races."

  STR_CEREBREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This specimen are not your typical alien race: its genetics are completely different to both Earth and most alien species, and it seems even stranger than most other types of alien life.  Most of its body mass is neural matter, and the rest is almost exclusively advanced cybernetics to keep this enormous 'brain' running.  It seems unable to use hand weapons, and it has no significant natural means of defense.  There is little else we can say about this terrifying creature."

  STR_CEREBREAL_LARVA_UFOPAEDIA: "This creature is a young form of a Cerebreal, encased in a tiny UFO-like vehicle for protection on the battlefield.  While not as potent as an adult Cerebreal, it's still a formidable monster, with high intelligence and notable psionic resilience.  Its vessel is equipped with a deadly plasma weapon."

  STR_CEREBREAL_LARVA_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This creature is almost entirely composed of brain tissue, encased in a hovering capsule.  This capsule is quite resilient to damage, especially bullets and laser beams.  It also features a plasma weapon, which is similar in profile to the Plasma Rifle."

  STR_CHTONITE_UFOPAEDIA: "Chtonites are a sturdy alien race, very well suited for menial work and harsh environmental conditions.  They prefer to live in underground compounds and would be harmed by sunlight, if not for their ocular implants.  Their intelligence is average, but they are more than capable of waging a war against mankind."

  STR_CHTONITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This alien has a strong and resilient body, but is otherwise quite similar to us.  Its thick skin gives it a good protection against bullets and blades alike.  Its eyes are protected by a pair of cybernetic 'goggles', which seem to enhance its vision as well as protect the eyes."

  STR_TUNLUN_UFOPAEDIA: "Tunluns burrow through the earth by spitting acid to corrode rocks for digestion, then shovel it aside with their flipper-like limbs. They are used by the Chtonites as living burrowing machines to build outposts and bases on Earth.  However, their acidic spit makes them perfect terror weapons as well.  Luckily, their overall intelligence is well below human."

  STR_TUNLUN_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This peculiar alien has a very small brain for a sentient creature, which suggests low intelligence.  It is equipped with a large tube for a mouth, which produces large amounts of highly corrosive substance that can be propelled and therefore used as a weapon.  Its skin is very tough and extremely difficult to puncture, as well as virtually immune to the creature's own acid."

  STR_REPTOID_UFOPAEDIA: Reptoids have been on Earth for quite a while, long before the invasion began.  Despite their bestial appearance, they possess extraordinary intelligence, which makes them excellent spies and field agents.  There is not much we can say about their origins, but their long history on Earth and their genetic closeness to ourselves point to a terrestrial genesis.  Nonetheless, their loyalty to aliens is absolute.

  STR_REPTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: This creature is covered with tough scales, able to withstand small caliber bullets with ease.  Curiously, despite its reptilian appearance, it seems to be quite resistant to heat.  Its brain is highly developed, suggesting a possibly superhuman intelligence.  Its most interesting feature however is their DNA, which is either terrestrial in origin or modelled after Earth creatures.

  STR_SALAMANDRON_UFOPAEDIA: The Salamandron is a frightening beast, vaguely resembling ancient predators but also quite different.  Designed solely for terror, it is equipped with incendiary rockets, able to lay waste to a small town within minutes.  Its behavior can regulated by a set of small receivers implanted into its brain, but it largely operates on its own, making it difficult to control but also virtually invulnerable to jamming.

  STR_SALAMANDRON_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: This creature is very sturdy, covered with thick scales and extremely resistant to heat, but not so much to laser cutters.  Its tiny brain features a number of small implants whose purpose seems to be provoking basic 'fight or flight' reactions within its system.

  STR_RIFLE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "This type of weapon is widely used by armies all around the world. Two types of rifles are used: Battle Rifles, heavier and more powerful, but difficult to fire and Assault Rifles, lighter and more accurate. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}Burst, three shots (Aimed slot). {NEWLINE}Control Auto, five shots (Auto slot)"

  STR_PISTOL_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The classic and trustworthy sidearm of the infantryman. Reliable and easy to use, it can save your life if used properly. Most of them are light and you can pull the trigger very fast (just keep in mind you will need to reload often). {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}Rapid fire, 3 shots (Auto slot)"

  STR_CARBINE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "This kind of weapons are used by special operation forces and commandos, basically a shortened version of a rifle that combines the firepower and lightness of an SMG and a Rifle, having a niche between the two. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}Double Tap, two shots (Snap slot). {NEWLINE}Full Auto, 10 shots (Auto slot)"

  STR_SMG_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Best used in close quarters and to clear buildings, this weapon type is focused on fire power and ROF rather than ranged combat. Best used for scouts and recon units. {NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Full Auto, 5-7 shots (Auto slot), {NEWLINE}Pray n' Spray, 10 shots (Aimed slot)"

  STR_SNIPER_RIFLE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Often are heavier rifles, meant to be used by marksmen and snipers to eliminate targets far away. Heavy and long barrels, with magnification scopes are the signature of this class of weapons. It's use at close range is not recommended. {NEWLINE}Special attack: Headshot, 1 shot (Auto slot)"

  STR_SHOTGUN_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Shotguns are powerful weapons and like SMGs, are meant to be used on close combat. Buckshots are great for crowd control and slugs are best for mid-range combat. The best use is to blast away an enemy at point-blank, still. {NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Rage Fire, all the ammo fired (Auto slot)"

  STR_ARTILLERY_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Large, heavy and adaptable. 'Artillery' is the nickname of the ordnance used by heavy weapons, like rocket launchers and recoilless rifles. Doesn't have a Special attack, but has varied ammo for many different situations, like destroying light enemies with HE rounds and tough adversaries with AP ammo."

  STR_LMG_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Squad-issued automatic weapons, meant to support the troops on the battlefield. The primary function is to saturate an area with fire to keep the enemy behind cover. {NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Burst, 5 shots (Snap slot). {NEWLINE}Suppression, 10-15 shots (Auto slot)"

  STR_WEAPON_REQUISITION_UFOPEDIA: "We can request a requisition of some weapons that we find on the battlefield, used by allied troops. This is completely optional, since we have our own weapons. Once the request is processed, the weapon in question will be available in our arsenal for acquisition."

  STR_GRENADE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Explosive devices that require a steady and strong arm to be propelled into the air. Light and very useful, it is recommended to have a skilled soldier to use them properly. "

  STR_MELEE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Melee weapons are very cheap tools, meant to be used in close combat when a weapon isn't available (either due running out of ammo or being broken). The effectiveness varies on the skill of the soldier using them, both melee and strength."

  STR_MEDICAL_ITEMS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Healing and recovering tools and medicine, meant to patch up wounds, recover stamina and health. Having a healthy soldier means another weapon firing on the enemies, don't forget to carry enough on the battlefield."

  STR_FOOD_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "It is said that an army marches on it stomach. Food rations, like canned meat or cigarettes, are important to keep a high morale. Read carefully the instructions on each item report to know the pros and cons of each ration."


  STR_SCOUT_POWER_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: This item combines Power Suit technology and Personal Armor frame to create armor focusing on increasing a soldier's mobility. However, this focus on speed and a need to maximize wearer's field of vision limits the suit's protective capabilities.

  STR_SCOUT_FLYING_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: This armor is an improvement over the Scout Power Armor, incorporating advances from the Flying Suit technology. The Scout Flying Armor offers the best mobility so far, combining faster movement and flight. But despite our advances, the suit is still less armored than a basic Power Suit.

  STR_ASTRONAUT_A7L_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Fully pressurized suit, perfect for extra vehicular activities in difficult terrain. Improved model of the A7L suit used by the American astronauts of the Apollo missions.  Includes sections of Alien Alloys to lessen the discomfort of the suit, but still limits the movements and reactions of the user. Includes magnetic boots.

  STR_ASTRONAUT_A7LB_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Combat variant of the A7 spacesuit, integrates Alien Alloy plates on the shoulders and legs to provide extra protection to limbs. Its main feature its a ballistic helmet inspired in LEVA (Lunar Extravehicular Visor Assembly) to provide increased resistance to damage that may break the helmet and compromise the survivability of the operator. Includes magnetic boots.

  STR_ASTRONAUT_A7_MMU_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Special A7 spacesuit equipped with a prototype Manned Maneuvering Unit designed by NASA. This 'jetpack' enables untethered EVA operations without restrictions. The propellant used is gaseous nitrogen, stored on armored tanks on the back of the MMU. It contains enough propellant to have 6 hours of EVA. It is smaller than the Soviet counterpart, the SPK.

  STR_ASTRONAUT_KRECHET94_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Fully pressurized spacesuit, designed and build on the Soviet Union. Originally meant to be used on the civilian Moon and Mars space programs only, it was quickly put on widespread production to be equipped by Warsaw Pact cosmonauts. Incorporates some parts made with Alien Alloys to help improve mobility of the user. Includes magnetic boots.

  STR_ASTRONAUT_KRECHET94B_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Combat variant of Krechet-94 suit, includes Alien Alloy pauldrons and leg armored plates to absorb damage to limbs. It's main difference with the standard Krechet-94 is a build-in Alien Alloys vest, to greatly increase the resistance to damage to torso.

  STR_ASTRONAUT_KRECHETMMU_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Specialized version of the Krechet spacesuit, features a build-in propulsion unit named SPK. Uses compressed oxygen as the propulsion system, stored and protected within the backpack-like structure. It has an autonomy of seven hours of extravehicular activity (EVA). Well liked by Warsaw Pact cosmonauts, it is larger than the American counterpart, the MMU.

A development of the sucessful Krechet suits, it integrates additional layers of Alien Alloys to increase the protection of the user. The visor was reinforced and tactical lights added to both sides of the helmet."
  STR_CORPSE_COSMONAUT_SPACESUIT: "Fallen Cosmonaut"
  STR_VKS_OPERATOR: "VKS Operator"
  STR_VKS_OPERATOR_SPACESUIT_UC: "ORLAN-MS ASSAULT SPACESUIT"
  STR_VKS_OPERATOR_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Modernized and improved version of the Orlan spacesuit, used exclusively by VKS Operators deployed in the frontlines. It may appear similar to the civilian Orlan, but it incoporates a series of clasified survey systems aimed to gain as much battlefield data as possible. Equipped with a SPKM gravitational propulsion unit."
  STR_CORPSE_VKS_OPERATOR_SPACESUIT: "Fallen Operator"


  STR_FERRET_CAR_UFOPEDIA:  The Ferret Scout Car is a British armoured fighting vehicle designed and built for reconnaissance purposes. These vehicles are provided by the United Nations, very used by the UN Peacekeeping Forces all around the globe. It has reduced armor, but is equipped with two powerful .50 caliber M2 Machine Guns (50 rds) and a smoke grenade dispenser (6 rds).

  STR_SHERIDAN_UFOPEDIA: The M551 Sheridan AR/AAV (Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle) is a light tank developed by the United States, provided to UNEXCOM for ground combat support. It's designed to be landed by parachute and to swim across rivers. It's armed with the technically advanced M81E1 152mm gun/launcher (20 rds), adapted for the use of the MGM-51 Shillelagh guided anti-tank missile (9 rds).

  STR_BMD1_UFOPEDIA: The BMD-1 is a Soviet airborne amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicle, first introduced in 1969. BMD stands for Boyevaya Mashina Desanta (literally 'Combat Vehicle of the Airborne'). It can be dropped by parachute and can be carried by our C-130 Hercules and although it resembles the BMP-1 it is in fact much smaller. It's main armament is composed of a 2A28 Grom 73mm semi-auto gun (40 rds) and a PKT coaxial MG (50 rds).

  STR_SALADIN_CAR_UFOPEDIA:  Excellent 6x6 armored car of British origin, was designed in the 50s and has been exported to numerous nations since then, proving its worth in Middle East countries. It is also used by the United Nations. Its Royal Ordnance Factory L5A1 76mm Gun (30 rds) is not designed to combat tanks, but to destroy fortifications and light vehicles. It has a coaxial M1919A4 machine gun (50 rds) to combat infantry.

  STR_IMP_TANK_CHASSIS_UFOPEDIA: Our tanks have proven to be highly useful on the battlefield when supporting our troops in their missions. However, the escalation in the conflict and the increase in the losses of the same, have led our engineers and scientists, together with tank developers of the world, to create a new type of tank using our new scientific advances. For this project we are developing a powerful laser cannon similar to the one mounted on airplanes, the 'Laser Gun, Model 34-3 Heavy Anti Tank Laser Cannon', we will use it in the developed tank.

  STR_LEGIONNAIRE_TANK_UFOPEDIA: Result of a joint project of USA, West Germany, UK and UNEXCOM engineers, the Light Assault Tank XM22 Legionnaire is armored with a strong armor based on Alien Alloys. It uses a unique cannon, the LGM34-3H ATLC, which fires high-powered laser munitions. Their 'cartridges' are actually one-use-per-shot batteries, physically similar to 90mm shells but 10 times more powerful (30 rds). It's support weapon is a turret mounted Laser Minigun (100 rds).

  STR_THIN_MAN_UFOPEDIA: "The Thin Man is an alien creature fused with human DNA to create what seems to be an infiltration agent. It has been shown to showcase some kind of psionic abilities, something that no doubt assists it when establishing networks of operatives."

  STR_THIN_MAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "While on the surface the subject, which we've christened as 'Thin Man', seems human, its internal organs show significant deviation. The Thin Mans DNA is similar to a regular humans, but it contains portions unlike anything found on earth. The subject is most likely a result of genetic manipulation."

  STR_ALIEN_ASSOCIATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "The capture of a high ranking terrorist has lead to an alarming development, the terrorist organisations we've been facing seem to have links to extraterrestrials. Multiple terrorist leaders have been seen armed with weaponry only seen before during highly classified encounters with alien life. The origins of these weapons must be tracked before knowledge of them spreads too far to contain, and before the terrorist can get their hands on anything with which they could cause significant damage."

  STR_TERRORIST_HQ_UFOPEDIA: "Thanks to the information gained from an high ranking terrorist and the assistance of multiple intelligence agencies we've been able to track down the source of the alien weapons. They seem to have been distributed by a small cell seemingly operating from a sizable suburban house. A raid into the building should put an stop to their operation."

  STR_TERRORISTS_UFOPEDIA: Terrorists are a diverse group of political, religious and ideological radicals who use violence and fear to impose their ideals or make demands on the world's governments. Each cell is independent of the others, but they use similar equipment and weaponry. They are extremely dangerous because they are not afraid to die.

  STR_TERRORISTS_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: Terrorist operations are often financed by extremist political or religious factions in countries around the world, who use terrorists as the means to achieve their goals without getting their hands dirty. They usually demand a ransom in the form of money or the release of prisoners loyal to their faction. Their activity has been greatly increased by the massive export of weapons from the Superpowers to Third World countries.

  STR_TERRORIST_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This is an ordinary human, with nothing we would not have seen in another member of our species and as easy to kill as an ordinary soldier. Some were equipped with bulletproof vests under their clothes, although in general their attire is that of a civilian, with some tactical elements of military origin, probably obtained illegally on the black market.

  STR_SMALL_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Though this UFO may not look like much, it is a fearsome combatant. Despite its lack of an aerodynamic design, it is faster than any aircraft found on Earth."

  STR_TROOP_LANDER_UFOPEDIA: "This massive vessel seems to serve as the aliens main method of transporting troops. Though being a transport, it is equipped with an extensive point-defence system, making it a severe threat to any assailant."

  STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER: "Sectoid Commander"
  STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_AUTOPSY: "Sectoid Commander Autopsy"

  STR_MUTON_LEADER: "Muton Guard"
  STR_ARMORED_MUTON: "Shock Muton"
  #STR_ARMORED_MUTON_LEADER: "Elite Muton Guard"
  STR_MECHTOID: "Mechtoid"
  STR_CYBERSPHERE: "Cybersphere"
  STR_PROBE: "Probe"
  STR_SECTOID_PSION_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Sectoid has a specially build 'harness' on its body. Connected directly on the brain, provides the user of extra energy to focus and expand the intensity of the psionic energy. Basically an antenna and a battery for the user's brain. It's use seems focused on controlling minds of lesser beings."
  STR_SECTOID_PSION_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Psions' are Sectoids specially trained to control alien beasts, even some allied aliens with lower intelligence. The 'Psionic Harness' transmits the orders directly into the subconscious mind and allows the Psion to control every aspect of the beast, from movement to neuronal activity... Pretty much like a puppeteer."
  STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Sectoid features a larger head than it's brethren. Looks naturally grown, as there are no signs of surgical procedures. The body seems to struggle to resist the weight of the larger cranium and the brain matter inside. Obviously, a perfect target for our snipers."
  STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "A highly evolved Sectoid, it's cranial cavity was genetically expanded to fit a larger brain. The Commander has a vast array of tactical and cultural knowledge, turning it into a literal genius on the battlefield. The heightened intelligence allows to take control of larger and more complex squads of aliens than a regular Sectoid."
  STR_MECHTOID_AUTOPSY: "Mechtoid Autopsy"
  STR_MECHTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The broken chassis of this mechanized unit reveals a complex array of tubbing and armored plates, along with two powerful legs. The propulsion unit looks a miniature Elerium reactor, but protected to avoid killing the user. Deeply inside, lies the rotten corpse of a Sectoid. Probably the pilot of the armored unit. The arm-mounted Heavy Plasma Cannons are very dangerous, but relatively slow to use."
  STR_MECHTOID_UFOPEDIA: "In order to bolster the strength of Sectoid squads, a Navigator boards a tall mechanized bipedal armor. Just the head remains unprotected. Powerful servomotors allow the 'Mechtoid' to run across large distances with ease. Compared to other units, features a relatively lighter armor (albeit still stronger than a regular human armored vehicle). It's crewman is still capable of using Psionics unhindered."
  STR_ARMORED_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: "In order to increase the durability of Sectoids in frontline combat against us, they have developed a fairly effective powered armor. Fully enclosed and with a breathing system, the user can withstand NBC environments and deflect standard human ballistic and plasma weaponry. They are susceptible to explosions and lasers, however."
  STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "A fearsome alien robotic unit, it's often the vanguard of enemy assaults. Heavy armored and highly resistant to most damage types (lasers and explosives seem to be effective). It's biggest weakness is also it's main weapon: dual Laser Gatling-like Cannons can easily dispatch most infantry with a hailstorm of energy beams."
  STR_ARMORED_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: "The Shock Mutons are specially trained to engage against highly organized enemy forces. Their armor protects them from all kind of damage and their enclosed helmet allows them to operate on toxic environments. The foot are unprotected, being a vulnerable side."
  STR_ARMORED_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "An extremely skilled Muton warrior, employed as both commanders of large alien contingents and personal guard for the Ethereal leaders. Their armors and helmets are decorated with large ornaments, shown with pride as a sign of status. They are the peak of the Muton hierarchy."
  STR_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "While regular Mutons are highly dependant on a psionic link with a superior being like Ethereals and Sectoids, this kind of alien serves as a NCOs for alien squads. They have developed a stronger individualism and will power. This is enough to command other aliens and support higher castes."
  STR_ARMORED_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "Serving as the usual frontline and recon unit is costly due the poor protection of the standard harness. This is why the Floater soldiers have been improved with armor whose protection rate is similar to other frontline units. This effectively doubles the survival rate within their ranks."
  STR_STRIDER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a subspecies of the Floaters, stronger and more resilient than their cybernetic-enhanced cousins. We think on them like the Homo Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens: two similar species with different specializations. They often wear heavy armor and provide close combat support to Floaters."
  STR_STRIDER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This alien is very similar to the Floater, perhaps a variation of them or a genetic relative. The cranium looks more sturdy but with more primitive facial features. The legs and arms are muscular in appearance, probably indicating this alien is used on heavy work."
  STR_PROBE_UFOPEDIA: "A small and very distinctive robotic unit. Used on survey and scientific missions, it's widely used to conduct recon over the area subject of study. Carries a defensive laser gun. Slow, but could kill a human soldier if left unchecked."
  STR_PROBE_AUTOPSY: "Probe Autopsy"
  STR_PROBE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The small hovering unit seems to be used to scout ahead the mission site and provide light support to other combat units. The chassis seems light and somewhat weak, but we have reports of a small energy weapon used on what appears self-defense."
  STR_CYBERSPHERE_UFOPEDIA: "A very specialized robot drone, used to seek, detect and pin down possible objectives. The data collected by this unit is relayed directly into the brains of the alien squad members, effectively turning this drone into another pair of eyes. It's extremely fast and agile."
  STR_CYBERSPHERE_AUTOPSY: "Cybersphere Autopsy"
  STR_CYBERSPHERE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The wreck reveals few things about the purpose of the flying object. It doesn't have any weapon and the chassis is really thin and light, it barely resists a couple of rifle rounds. The antigravity propulsion unit is very compact too, looks like it's meant mostly as recon and survey tasks."
  STR_ALIEN_RANKS: "Alien Ranks"
  STR_ALIEN_RANKS_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens have a cohesive, organized and highly specialized military. Similar to human armies, each member of a squad has assigned a role and function. It seems they haven't developed the concept of concealment nor camuflaje, because they often use bright colors to identify each rank. Capturing them could give us a better perspective of our enemy. Red is meant to leaders. Brown is used on technicians and combat engineers. Blue is employed by sanitary and medical personnel. Orange is assigned to pilots and ship crew. Green is the color of the regular soldiers. It's unknown if the colors meant something for them or not. But at least, makes things easier to us."
  STR_ARMORED_ALIENS: "Armored Aliens"
  STR_ARMORED_ALIENS_UFOPEDIA: "Personal armor is widely distributed to alien infantry. However, it's use is restricted according the mission carried by the crew of a ship. If the personnel is conducting 'scientific' missions, lighter weapons and few or no personal armor are used. However, if the enemy expects to engage in heavy combat, said restrictions are lifted and more destructive equipment is used without hesitation. We are the one of the few, if not the first, race who resisted longer than a couple of weeks. We could expect a change in their equipment strategy anytime soon."

#LORE REPORTS
  STR_STORY_REPORT_1: "Report #1: Operation Downfall"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "October 26th, 1974. After three weeks of travel, three battlecruisers of allied nations - UNS Enterprise, UNS Marathon and UNS Stalingrad - made their way to Martian orbit, and attacked alien forces. With them, a small landing team, including UNEXCOM special squad, landed in a Cydonia, near Ethereals main HQ. After 2 hours of fierce battle, UNEXCOM squad infiltrated the headquarters and managed, despite heavy resistance, to destroy alien commanders, toppling their resistance. Yet, evacuation wasn't possible due to high amount of alien forces, and squad leader had to call an orbital strike at their location. Aliens was wiped out due to heavy bombings, and Cydonia's facilities were destroyed. Humans flew back home victorious, with defeated enemy behind. War of 1972 has ended."
  STR_STORY_REPORT_2: "Report #2: Preparation for colonisation"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_2_UFOPEDIA: "A couple of years after, in 1976, at 25th convention of CPSU, the Soviet leaders had announced their plans for colonisation of Mars. By this plan, they aimed to create a first military bases on Red Planet by 1978, and soon after - start a scientific expeditions. This plan has received a huge amount of attention from international society and, most importantly, attention from USA and NATO, which immediately started their negotiations. Soon, in summer of 1976, an international convention started in Oxford, Great Britain, where delegates from allied nations has created an addition to Sevastopol Agreements. In this addition, they're agreed to share any scientific data, collected during expeditions on Mars, and give access to their installments for all other sides. And with it, preparations had begun."
  STR_STORY_REPORT_3: "Report #3: Interwar period"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_3_UFOPEDIA: "Earlier estimations by the UNSC for a invasion of Mars required a significant task force of Orion battleships (preferably at least five) to be ready before any attempted attack. In order to archive this, the global economy was forced to partially shift their initial focus of rebuilding the destroyed cities to arm again for war.  The World Powers managed to keep high the population morale after a long series of aggressive propaganda aimed to ridiculize the now-defeated Ethereals and glorify the human victories in the War of 1972. Movies, radio and TV shows were made by dozens. There were concerns of certain civilian sectors about how many countries have become heavily militarized, although their voices fell in deaf ears. A burning hate towards the alien enemy was difficult to quell... and actually easy to keep, as the world leaders found. Mankind was more united than ever."
  STR_STORY_REPORT_4: "Report #4: Base Modules"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_4_UFOPEDIA: "The problem with a permanent human settlement in the Red Planet is the harshness of the environment and the constant threat of alien insurgents raiding said settlements. The solution was found actually before the War of 1972. During the Secret Crisis in the early 60s, several alien crafts were shot down around Kansas and Nevada. Engineers from the Area 51 branch of the CIA special unit Bureau 11 designed a mobile fortified barracks for the armed forces, made with the alien alloys. The end of the global conflict in the early 70s saw the fundation of Schwabauer Tech Inc, by the former lead engineers of B11. They adapted their schematics to use the hundreds of UFO wrecks into a compact, orbital-dropped, reinforced habitat, widely used by Earth's forces in Mars."
  STR_STORY_REPORT_5: "Report #5: Call to arms"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_5_UFOPEDIA: "By autumn of 1978, the newly build Orion Battleships were almost ready for deployment. The 'United Nations Martian Operational Commission' established by the Space Command prepared a series of plans for the upcoming invasion of the Red Planet. To establish a beachhead, UNEXCOM would probably be forced to land a major contingent of troops, mostly compromising of NATO, US and Soviet forces, numbering in the thousands and containing armored vehicles. Any counterattacks against this force would be pushed back with orbital bombardment. An open call were made to the world militaries to gather volunteers for the attack. Most of the recruitment centers were quickly saturated. Some of the selected few were veterans of the Lunar Campaign, the Underground Defense Campaign and Operation Downfall, as they had the most experience fighting in such hostile conditions. The others were special forces operators from all over the world, specially those with experience on mountain and desertic warfare."
  STR_STORY_REPORT_6: "Report #6: First landings"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_6_UFOPEDIA: "In January 20th, 1979, the united fleet of allied nations, UNS Enterprise, UNS Austerlitz, UNS Stalingrad and UNS Bagration, started their approach to Martian orbit. This operation, known as Operation Cleanup in classified documents, started their second phase with landings on a martian surface at February 5th, 1979. Those landings did a Mars surface survey, looking for any signs of alien activity, but, surprisingly, they found nothing. So, Operation Cleanup was deemed technically succesful, even though there was no aliens to fight. After that, in February 9th, allied nations started a construction of permanent military bases at Arcadia Plains, named as Suvorov station for Soviet Space Forces, MacArthur for USSF, and Napoleon for UASCNAT"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_7: "Report #7: Establishing Expansion"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_7_UFOPEDIA: "After Operation Cleanup and creation of the first military bases on Mars, allied nations started to slowly expand their spheres of influence. First, international scientific base, known as New Horizon, were founded in 1979, who started exploring the Red Planet. With generous fundings from both goverments and private companies, new bases and settlements are started appearing rapidly, be it for scientific or military purposes. Th humanity slowly, yet surely were securing it's position on Mars, turning planet into their backyard"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_8: "Report #8: UNEXCOM in Interwar period"
  STR_STORY_REPORT_8_UFOPEDIA: "After War of 1972 and succesful Operation Downfall, UNEXCOM became heroes in the eyes of international society. Memorial with the list of UNEXCOM operatives, died in battles with alien threat, was installed near UN HQ in New York, and many streets and small towns were named after those heroes. And yet there was a lot of work ahead for UNEXCOM: remnants of the alien squads, terrorising rural areas, hordes of Chryssalids in the vast forests of Syberia and Amazonia, and even small rogue communities of Snakemen in Africa. And after all this work, in 1976, UNEXCOM was greatly reduced to a single base and a small group of operatives to guard the most dangerous captured alien technologies. And yet, in 1980, with a start of alien insurgency activity on Mars, UNEXCOM was expanded again, and brought to Mars, with a job to work against alien activity, thanks to the it's strategists, with a considerable level of expertise about alien tactics and capabilities"

  STR_MARS_ORBITAL_DEFENSE_REPORT: "Operational Report - Mars Orbital Defense"
  STR_MARS_ORBITAL_DEFENSE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The main Mars planetary defense is carried by an international squadron of Orion ships - usually a couple of battleships and several frigates or destroyers. In order to boost said fleet, a large number of spaceplane wings are prepared for deployment from launch pads near the UN military bases, with a couple dozen already in orbit. This projection of power is deemed essential to maintain the human position in Mars and considered strong enough to keep the Ethereal insurgency at bay. There have been some incidents with vehicles damaged or shot down by hidden Elerium Fusion-equipped SAM batteries, but the UNSC considers them isolated actions."
  
  STR_UNEXCOM_MARS_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT: "Operational Report - UNEXCOM's deployment in Mars "
  STR_UNEXCOM_MARS_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Being tasked to engage aliens in asymmetrical combat for years made the United Nations Extraterrestrial Combat Command the most experienced unit in dealing with both the invaders and unconventional warfare against them. The nations of the world were accustomed to symmetrical warfare... now it is exceedingly harder on Mars, as we are in foreign lands where coalitions find it hard to coordinate or upkeep consistent supply lines. This made us the prime choice of the UNSC when the Ethereal insurgency became a serious problem. We're equiped with the latest version of the Marauder Powered Armor System, as we're expected to operate behind the enemy lines. Most of our Legionaries are hardened veterans of countless battles against the alien vermin, some even since the Secret War twenty years ago."
  
  STR_ETHEREAL_INSURGENCY_REPORT_1: "Operational Report - Ethereal Insurgency I"
  STR_ETHEREAL_INSURGENCY_REPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "After the decisive victory of the Operation Downfall and the lack of opposition in Operation Cleanup, the UN considered the remnants of the alien hierarchy completely disabled, incapable of conducting any further military action. We were wrong. First labeled as 'minor incidents', the alien guerrillas were persistent in their terror campaign until being recognized as a real threat. The major issue is the incapability of the World Powers and their relatively new spaceborne military forces to deal with an enemy who attacks without warning and vanishes in the Martian dunes, without trace. That's why we were called back to service. We need to interrogate an insurgent leader in order to know more about them, although we suspect the presence of a new Brain."
  STR_ETHEREAL_INSURGENCY_REPORT_2: "Operational Report - Ethereal Insurgency II"
  STR_ETHEREAL_INSURGENCY_REPORT_2_UFOPEDIA: "We became aware of the presence of alien 'civilian' settlements when our survey teams began their mission of cartography the planet at detail (something previously almost impossible with Earth-launched probes). After destroying the Brain back in 1974, the alien races part of the enemy collective broke free from the Ethereal control. And it seems the secessionist movement happened in Mars as well. Without a concrete leader, each warlord fights other factions for land and resources, sometimes even armed with primitive weapons. This, of course, benefit us. At least some of the aliens are willing to dialogue with us, even side with us if we support them against their opposition. The clearest example was the Third Battle of Bello Horizonte, in 1977. UN-led forces fighting to liberate the city were joined by a battalion-sized splinter Muton party led by a powerful Psionic human and successfully annihilated a Chryssalid hive. In an unprecedented diplomatic move, they requested the Brazilian government for political asile, which was granted two years later. This may help us in our efforts to secure the Red Planet."
  STR_ETHEREAL_INSURGENCY_REPORT_3: "Operational Report - Ethereal Insurgency III"
  STR_ETHEREAL_INSURGENCY_REPORT_3_UFOPEDIA: "The captured leader confirmed our suspected hypothesis: there's a new Brain operating in Mars. A certain Ethereal faction regained control of a partially-build backup Brain and began subduing opposing alien forces, subjugating them if they didn't joined them voluntarily. And this happened more or less at the same time we were preparing for the occupation of Mars. This explains the surge of enemy activity several months after Operation Cleanup, as they didn't had enough power to compete and destroy other factions. We have requested the UNSC for reinforcements in order to locate this new Brain and destroy it once and for all. It's just a matter of waiting till the cavalry arrives, meanwhile we should try to keep the guerrilla at bay."
  
  STR_PSIONIC_LORE_REPORT_1: "7 years of Psionics Circle"
  STR_PSIONIC_LORE_REPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "During the War of 1972, UNEXCOM managed to capture a few Ethereals. Interrogating and studying them have led to one of the most notorious change for humanity since industrialisation - psionics. And today the organisation, known as Psionic Circle, are celebrating seventh anniversary of their creation, which was at December 18, 1975. The Psionic Circle was founded by scientists from classified USA scientific base, who studied psi technology, shared by UNEXCOM. Their goal is to be an official representatives of psionics all across the Earth in order to protect from any ill-treatment. Allied forces have special psi corps too, and we could ask them to help us with it's manpower, if situation escalates"
  
  STR_SOVIET_PSIONIC_CORPS_REPORT_1: "Tactical Report - SA Psionic Corps I"
  STR_SOVIET_PSIONIC_CORPS_REPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "During the Secret War, Directorate 17 agents managed to capture a few Thin Men. Upon succesful delivery in Soviet Union, in closed town of Novosibirsk-54, scientists from Institute of Alien Technology, located here, started their research. During interrogation, they not only found out the location of some alien hideouts in Europe, but also discovered their psi abilities, and hidden psi potential in some of the humans. After sending their reports to Kremlin, scientists later received a new order: find the way to awaken psi abilities and then organise and train the small team of psionics. This project took a several years to complete, but at the end of 1960s Institute has succeded in that task."
  STR_SOVIET_PSIONIC_CORPS_REPORT_2: "Tactical Report - SA Psionic Corps II"
  STR_SOVIET_PSIONIC_CORPS_REPORT_2_UFOPEDIA: "At the beginning of War of 1972, Soviet Union had tried to deploy that small team on the battlefield to see how effective it's gonna be. And the results has been greatly exceeded their expectations. And so, in 1974, Leonid Brezhnev has personally gave an order to high command of Soviet Army to create a full-scale regiments of military psionics. With use of technologies and techniques from Novosibirsk-54, SA has created Psionic Forces at the middle of 1976, with General-Lieutenant Yuri Yuriev, from the first psi squad, at their command. Soviet psionics are best that Soviet Union can offer. Psi corps accept soldiers with psi power rating (according to Tihonenko-Sergeev rating system), higher that 90. This soldiers also complete hard and tense training courses making them skilled and powerful enough to become major threat at the battlefield for aliens"
  
  STR_NATO_CYBORG_OPERATORS_REPORT_1: "Tactical Report - UASCNAT Cyberoperators I"
  STR_NATO_CYBORG_OPERATORS_REPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "During the War of 1972, allied nations has been studied all alien tech they recovered, including corpses of killed and captured aliens. And main interest for european scientists was an alien augmentations, used to enhance their abilities. In association with american scientists, they're developed new prosthetics, able to react at the brain commands as fast as natural limbs,which were used to help heavily injured soldiers return back to fight. After the end of war, those scientists has founded a 'CyberSpartan Pharm. Inc.', and then received a huge fundings from USA and some european countries."
  STR_NATO_CYBORG_OPERATORS_REPORT_2: "Tactical Report - UASCNAT Cyberoperators II"
  STR_NATO_CYBORG_OPERATORS_REPORT_2_UFOPEDIA: "They kept on developing augmentation technology, and in 1977 has received a special request from main command of NATO. They were interested in possible opportunities, created by augmentations, and now wanted to get a new type of forces, composed of heavily augmented soldiers. This research project, codenamed 'Project Reborn', has been succesfully finished in 1980, and this the first human cyborgs has been created. This Cyberoperators are stronger and more agile than normal humans, and less vulnerable to damage, but their adaptation skills has suffered after implantation"
  
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_USSF: "Faction Report - USSF"
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_USSF_UFOPEDIA: "The American interest in the militarization of space begun even before the Space Race. After gaining its independence from the US Army, the US Air Force started developing ballistic missiles in the early 50s. The success of Sputnik 1 and several congressional pressures resulted in three separate Space branches. Eventually, the Aerospace Defense Command became active in 1968, still dependant on the USAF. Its ultimate purpose was justified in the orbital raids in late 1973 and the subsequent Lunar Campaign. By 1980, it was reformed into the US Space Force, becoming a separate branch. The USSF Rangers are handpicked elements from the Air Force and Marines, enduring a 6-weeks long training in Fort Tranquility, Moon."
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_NASA: "Faction Report - NASA"
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_NASA_UFOPEDIA: "The main space exploration civilian agency of the United States is directly responsible for the development of American space tech and materials. While initially it struggled to compete with the Soviet space program, the first crewed landing on the Moon gave it the necessary public and financial support to further expand the human presence in space. One of the most important achievements by the National Aeronautics Space Administration is the development of the novel Space Shuttle and the Orion Nuclear Pulse Battleships, two of the groundbreaking technological innovations which gave Earth an edge over the Ethereals in the 1972-1974 conflict."
  
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_UASCNAT: "Faction Report - UASCNAT"
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_UASCNAT_UFOPEDIA: "WIP"
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_ESA: "Faction Report - ESA"
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_ESA_UFOPEDIA: "The European Space Agency is the joint effort of all the Western European nations, spearheaded by France, Italy and the Unified Germany. Initially two separate agencies tasked with developing rockets and satellites, the alien conflict of 1972 made clear Europe needed a common space agency tasked on researching the invader's movements in outer space and how yo include their tech for the benefits of mankind's dream of conquering the stars. Founded in 1973 after the merge of ESRO and ELDO, its peak of activity started after the official end of the War, with logistics support for the Allied forces fighting the alien remnants in the Moon. Since the return of the UN to Mars, the ESA has relentlessly worked along NASA to establish a permanent human settlement on the Red Planet, with routine rocket launches ferrying cargo and travelers between both planets."
  
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_VKS: "Faction Report - VKS"
  STR_FACTIONS_REPORT_VKS_UFOPEDIA: "The beginning of VKS started in 1955 with a started building the scientific polygon for rockets testing, which later became a Baikonur spaceport. Success with USSR space program, such as first satellite at Earth's orbit, first man on space and first human vessel on Moon, in next 15 years has drawn an attention from high military ranks. And so, in 1964, they created a Central Space Administration, which was reorganised in 1970 as Main Space Administration, to centralise researching a new space assets for military purposes and effectively control their use. At the start of War of 1972, MSA worked hard to develop a technologies, that will allow Union to effectively deal with Ethereals in the space. For example, a Krechet space suit, based upon suit, used by Alexei Leonov, first man in open space. In 1974, with construction of UNS Stalingrad, the first military space vessel of Soviet Union, soldiers, dispatched to it, were organised as separate branch of military, becoming the first VKS ('Military Space Forces', or 'Voenno-Kosmicheskie Sily' in russian) unit. Succesful ending of both Operation Devastation and Operation Downfall, with soviet troops fighting hard to achieve victory, Soviet Army began construction of new space ships, thus enlarging their Space Forces. Also, in 1977, military were reorganised, and Air Forces were merged into VKS, due to exo-atmospheric jets becoming a new standard military aircraft. Also, VKS is known for their Space Drop Troopers, trained on the Friendship of Nations base on Moon. They're coming through hard training, including courses of survival in airless conditions and movement in rough terrains of Moon and Mars" 
  
  STR_BALLISTIC_WEAPONS_REPORT: "Logistics Report - Ballistic Weapons"
  STR_BALLISTIC_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The great leap forward in most science fields after the War quickly made outdated several items and equipment previously thought 'cutting-edge'. The prevalence of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) slowly and surely made most ballistic weaponry an obsolete tech. Those are not completely useless, though; as the expansion of 3D printing made them extremely cheap it became easy to just print ammo and even entire firearms in relatively small factories. Several minor powers still field classic rifles and machine guns, but the World Powers have relegated their arsenals as reserve equipment, no longer meant for frontline combat. Some modernized rifles made their way to Mars, where they are used by patrolling and garrison forces. "
  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_REPORT: "Logistics Report - Laser Weapons"
  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The most important military development since the creation of the atomic bomb was also one of the 'victory weapons' widely recognized as one of the key tools in the Ethereal defeat in Earth. Result of a decade-long research, the 1st Generation Lasers of the early 60s were bulky and unwieldily, but more effective than a regular rifle. The 2nd Generation began operational service in the middle of the War of 1972, turning the tide of the conflict. The start of the decade saw the introduction of even better laser guns in the form of the 3rd Generation, although 2-GEN lasers are likely to be prominent DEW technology field by most major Powers for several more years. Most 3-GEN weapons are used in the ongoing Martian conflict, while military forces in Earth are equipped with Second Generation assets. It seems our enemies have developed another generation of Lasers on their own too, as they are employing mew models never seen before. "
  
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_REPORT: "Logistics Report - Plasma Weapons"
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Plasma weapons became an staple of the enemy invasion, even when technically lasers were more used. Very powerful and really difficult to adapt to human needs, the Plasma equipment never became as widespread as hard light or alloy weaponry. The difficulty on the adaptation and maintenance of each piece of equipment relegated the use to just few special forces. Even now, the relative scarcity of the ammunition restricts the use in the current human military intervention. Each plasma bolt fired needs to be worthy. But the raw firepower compensates the expensiveness of the use. The deployment of human Plasmas put the soldiers in equal terms to the invading forces." 
  
  STR_ALLOY_WEAPONS_REPORT: "Logistics Report - Alloy Weapons"
  STR_ALLOY_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "A major creation of the engineering staff in the UNEXCOM HQ during the 1972-1974 conflict, the Alloy weaponry became the most reliable alternative to laser equipment. Those were used only by the Extraterrestrial Combat Command, as we had the most reserves of alien alloys. Tactically flexible and easy to maintain, many minor powers adopted them after the War. Ten years later, the new iterations of Alloy weapons are used by UN Peacekeepers deployed in stabilizing warzones all over the Earth and Mars."
  
  STR_UNEXCOM_WEAPONS_REPORT: "Logistics Report - UNEXCOM Weapons"
  STR_UNEXCOM_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The nature of our missions demand us to use specialized equipment, as the standard service weapons are not always enough. The standard choice for UNEXCOM battalions deployed in outer space are Gyrojet ballistics, specially adapted to Zero-G combat. Expensive to maintain and field, only the UN special forces are permitted to employ them in numbers. To engage heavily armored aliens or vehicles, unique Electric and Gauss weapons are available as well. Originally developed by intelligence services to help in the War against the Ethereals, the prohibitive costs reduced them to handcrafted pieces, not officially issued to our forces but allowed by the Security Council, as the results were satisfactory. However, we're able to secure any piece of equipment needed to our operations, no matter the origin or affiliation. "
  
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_REPORT: "Logistics Report - Bio-Fusion Weapons"
  STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The most fearsome alien equipment field in the conflict for Earth wasn't even created, but grown. Organic technology born in a distant planet and adapted for war, the Ethereal forces used them only after the end of the war... after the human defenders began to defeat the invaders in every front. The assets were the hardest to be reverse-engineered, the only R&D team able to do so was the UN science lab based in Yokohama, Japan. With their research, they could adapt a Fusion Rifle to be used by humans. Dangerous to both the operator and the target, the Peacemakers were used to wreak havoc among the enemy forces. Some are assigned to the Martian occupation forces to augment UN units."

  STR_MEDAL_RIFLE_MARKSMAN_UFOPEDIA: "The rifle is the main weapon of an infantryman. A soldier is useless without their rifle and a rifle is useless without its soldier.

  STR_MEDAL_RAIDER_SPECIALIST_UFOPEDIA: "Melee equipment such as swords and clubs are used by the humans since the beginning of times, way before the creation of ranged weapons.
